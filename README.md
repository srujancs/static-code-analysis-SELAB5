# 🧮 Lab 5: Static Code Analysis (Python)

## 🏫 Course Information
**Course:** Software Engineering Laboratory  
**Lab No:** 5  
**Title:** Static Code Analysis  
**Student Name:** Srujan C S  
**Institution:** [Your College Name Here]  
**Date:** [Insert Submission Date]

## 🧰 Tools and Technologies Used
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **Pylint** | Detects code quality and logic issues (naming, unused variables, dangerous patterns) |
| **Flake8** | Enforces PEP8 style and formatting standards |
| **Bandit** | Identifies security vulnerabilities and unsafe coding practices |
| **GitHub Codespaces** | Cloud-based IDE for running and editing the lab code |
| **Python 3.x** | Programming language used for the analysis |
| **Git** | Version control to commit and push the lab work to GitHub |

## 🧩 Initial Code Summary
The initial `inventory_system.py` was a simple inventory tracker with functions to:
- Add and remove items  
- Load and save data to JSON  
- Print and check stock levels  

However, it contained **several issues** such as:
- Mutable default argument (`logs=[]`)
- Missing docstrings
- Inconsistent naming (`addItem`, `removeItem`)
- Bare `except:` statements
- Use of insecure `eval()`
- Missing encoding in file I/O
- Unused imports
- PEP8 spacing and formatting errors
